# Development Conventions

For project-specific development conventions, refer to:

- **Development Guidelines**: @docs/claude/development-guidelines.md
- **Git Workflow**: @docs/operations/git-workflow.md

## General Conventions

- **Consistent Project Structure**: Organize files and directories in a predictable, logical structure that team members can navigate easily
- **Version Control Best Practices**: Use clear commit messages, feature branches, and meaningful pull/merge requests with descriptions
- **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables for configuration; never commit secrets or API keys to version control
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up-to-date and minimal; document why major dependencies are used
- **Testing Requirements**: Define what level of testing is required before merging (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
