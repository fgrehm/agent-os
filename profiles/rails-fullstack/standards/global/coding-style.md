# Coding Style Standards

For comprehensive coding style standards, refer to the centralized documentation:

- **Ruby Style**: @docs/claude/ruby-style.md
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Style**: @docs/claude/javascript-typescript.md
- **Rails Development Guidelines**: @docs/claude/development-guidelines.md

## Project-Specific Principles

- **Backward compatibility only when required**: Unless specifically instructed otherwise, assume you do not need to write additional code logic to handle backward compatibility
- **Precise technical terminology**: Describe what was actually done, not perceived impact
- **Avoid marketing jargon**: No "comprehensive", "robust", "seamless", "cutting-edge"
