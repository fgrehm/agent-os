## Coding style best practices

- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for scripts, functions, and variables
- **Meaningful Names**: Choose names that reveal intent; avoid abbreviations except for well-known ones
- **Small, Focused Scripts**: Each script should have one clear purpose
- **Consistent Indentation**: Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces) and enforce with editors
- **Remove Dead Code**: Delete unused code and commented-out blocks
- **DRY Principle**: Extract common logic into reusable functions or shared templates
- **Modular Organization**: Break large configurations into smaller, focused files
