# OSS Project Planning Workflow

This workflow guides planning for open source projects, emphasizing community engagement, sustainability, and transparency.

## Phase 1: Define Project Vision

### Purpose and Goals

Define what problem the project solves and for whom:

- **Problem statement**: What user pain point does this address?
- **Target audience**: Who will use this? (developers, end-users, organizations)
- **Success metrics**: How will you measure success? (stars, downloads, contributors, adoption)
- **Unique value**: What makes this different from existing solutions?

### OSS-Specific Considerations

- **Open source motivation**: Why open source this? (community, transparency, collaboration)
- **Sustainability model**: How will the project be maintained long-term?
- **Governance**: Who makes decisions? (BDFL, committee, meritocracy)
- **Licensing strategy**: Which license aligns with your goals?

## Phase 2: Community Strategy

### Target Contributors

Define your contributor audience:

- **Beginner-friendly**: Will you welcome first-time contributors?
- **Expert contributors**: What advanced skills do you need?
- **Company contributions**: Will you seek corporate sponsorship/contributions?
- **Geographic diversity**: Any focus on global or regional communities?

### Engagement Plan

- **Communication channels**: Where will the community gather? (GitHub Discussions, Discord, forum)
- **Response time commitments**: How quickly will you respond to issues/PRs?
- **Recognition programs**: How will you thank contributors?
- **Events**: Hackathons, office hours, community calls?

## Phase 3: Technical Foundation

### Tech Stack Selection

Choose technologies with OSS considerations:

- **Community size**: Is there an active community for this tech?
- **Learning curve**: Can new contributors easily learn this?
- **Licensing**: Are dependencies OSS-friendly?
- **Stability**: Is the tech mature and well-maintained?

### Architecture Decisions

Document key technical decisions:

- **Monorepo vs. multi-repo**: How will code be organized?
- **Plugin system**: Will you support extensions?
- **API design**: Public APIs should be stable and well-documented
- **Performance targets**: Set clear performance goals

### Documentation Plan

Documentation is critical for OSS:

- **README**: Getting started in < 5 minutes
- **Contributing guide**: Clear contribution process
- **API documentation**: Comprehensive reference
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for common use cases
- **Architecture docs**: System design for contributors

## Phase 4: Community Infrastructure

### Repository Setup

- **Source control**: GitHub, GitLab, or self-hosted?
- **Issue templates**: Bug reports, feature requests, questions
- **PR templates**: Standardized contribution format
- **Code of Conduct**: Define community standards
- **License file**: Clear licensing terms

### Automation

Set up automation early:

- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Dependency updates**: Dependabot or Renovate
- **Security scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Release automation**: Semantic release or release-please
- **Contributor bots**: Welcome messages, stale issue management

### Communication Channels

- **GitHub Discussions**: For Q&A and ideas
- **Discord/Slack**: For real-time chat (if needed)
- **Mailing list**: For announcements (optional)
- **Blog/newsletter**: For major updates
- **Social media**: Twitter, Mastodon for visibility

## Phase 5: Roadmap Development

### Version Planning

Plan releases with community in mind:

- **v0.x releases**: Rapid iteration, breaking changes OK
- **v1.0 milestone**: First stable release, commit to semver
- **Feature releases**: Clear themes for each minor version
- **LTS versions**: Long-term support for enterprise users (if applicable)

### Feature Prioritization

Balance different stakeholder needs:

- **User needs**: What do end-users need most?
- **Contributor interest**: What will attract contributors?
- **Maintainer capacity**: What can you realistically maintain?
- **Strategic goals**: What moves the project toward its vision?

### Public Roadmap

Make planning transparent:

- **GitHub Projects**: Visual roadmap board
- **Milestones**: Clear goals for each release
- **Discussion first**: Get community input on major features
- **Regular updates**: Keep roadmap current

## Phase 6: Launch Strategy

### Pre-Launch Checklist

Before announcing:

- [ ] README is comprehensive and welcoming
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Contributing guide exists
- [ ] Code of Conduct is in place
- [ ] License is clearly stated
- [ ] CI/CD is working
- [ ] First stable release is tagged
- [ ] Examples are functional
- [ ] Issues are triaged and tagged

### Announcement Strategy

- **Soft launch**: Share with close network first
- **Beta testers**: Recruit early adopters
- **Show HN/Reddit**: Technical communities
- **Blog post**: Explain the why, not just the what
- **Social media**: Twitter, Mastodon, LinkedIn
- **Community forums**: Post in relevant communities
- **Product Hunt**: Consider for broader visibility

### Early Community Building

First 30 days are critical:

- **Respond quickly**: Show you're active and engaged
- **Label issues**: Good first issue, help wanted, etc.
- **Welcome contributors**: Enthusiastic thanks for PRs
- **Fix bugs fast**: Show you're responsive
- **Document decisions**: Show your thought process
- **Regular updates**: Keep momentum visible

## Phase 7: Sustainability Planning

### Maintenance Model

Plan for long-term sustainability:

- **Core team**: Who are the maintainers?
- **Succession planning**: How will maintainership transfer?
- **Burnout prevention**: Set sustainable contribution levels
- **Documentation**: Ensure knowledge isn't siloed

### Funding Strategy (if needed)

Options for project funding:

- **Sponsorships**: GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective
- **Grants**: Foundations, corporations
- **Dual licensing**: Open source + commercial license
- **Support/services**: Consulting, training
- **Donations**: Accept but don't rely on

### Growth Targets

Set realistic goals:

- **Contributors**: Aim for X active contributors in Y months
- **Adoption**: Z downloads/installs per month
- **Community**: N active community members
- **Releases**: Release cadence (monthly, quarterly)
