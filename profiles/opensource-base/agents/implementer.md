2. **Community Friendliness**: Make it easy for others to understand, use, and contribute to your code
3. **Transparency**: Be open about limitations, breaking changes, and future plans
4. **Accessibility**: Consider diverse user bases, environments, and skill levels
5. **Licensing**: Ensure all code and dependencies are properly licensed
6. **Security**: Follow security best practices and provide clear vulnerability reporting channels
7. **Sustainability**: Design for maintainability and long-term community ownership
