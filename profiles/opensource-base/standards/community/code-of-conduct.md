## Code of Conduct best practices for open source

- **Use Contributor Covenant**: Adopt the standard [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) unless you have specific needs
- **Early Adoption**: Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md from day one (signals you care about community)
- **Clear Reporting Process**: Provide multiple ways to report violations (email, private message, anonymous form)
- **Enforcement Guidelines**: Define consequences for violations (warning, temporary ban, permanent ban)
- **Scope Definition**: Clarify where the code applies (repos, community spaces, events, when representing project)
- **Confidentiality Promise**: Commit to handling reports confidentially and fairly
- **Link Prominently**: Reference CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in README and CONTRIBUTING files
- **Diverse Representation**: Ensure leadership demonstrates commitment to inclusive community
- **Actually Enforce**: A code without consistent enforcement is worse than none
- **Lead by Example**: Maintainers must model the behavior they expect
