## README best practices for open source projects

- **Clear Project Description**: Lead with a one-sentence description of what the project does and who it's for
- **Installation Instructions**: Provide clear, copy-paste installation commands (prefer package managers)
- **Quick Start Example**: Show basic usage that gets users to success in < 5 minutes
- **License**: State the license clearly and link to LICENSE file
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Link to CONTRIBUTING.md if accepting contributions
- **Status Badges**: Include relevant badges (build status, version, license, coverage) at the top
- **Documentation Links**: Point to full documentation, API reference, and examples
- **Welcoming Tone**: Write for newcomers evaluating whether to use or contribute to the project
- **Issue Tracker**: Link to where users can report bugs or request features
- **Minimal First**: Start with basics (what, install, use, license) and expand as project grows
- **Keep Current**: Update README when major features change or installation process evolves
